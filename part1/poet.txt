The Road Not Taken

未选择的路

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

黄色的树林里分出两条路

可惜我不能同时去涉足

我在那路口久久伫立

我向着一条路极目望去

直到它消失在丛林深处

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

但我却选择了另外一条路

它荒草萎萎，十分幽寂

显得更诱人，更美丽

虽然在这两条小路上

都很少留下旅人的足迹

And both that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

虽然那天清晨落叶满地

两条路都未经脚印污染

呵，留下一条路等改日再见

但我知道路径延绵无尽头

恐怕我难以再回返

I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood, and

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.
